# Philadelphia Playbills Project Data

This is the repository for the data produced for the Philadelphia Playbills Project.  This was an NEH funded project hosted by Penn Libraries in 2018/19. The data hosted here is a JSON-LD data set produced from transcriptions of playbills, and metadata for materials in the Furness Shakespeare library that has been cleaned and enhanced with URIs for use with Linked Open Data (LOD).
